# Section E — Comprehensions & Utility Problems 
# Q18. Filter and Transform with Comprehension 
# Topics: Dictionary Comprehension 
# Problem Statement: 
# Given a list of user dictionaries, use a single dictionary comprehension to create a mapping of username → email for users who are active and aged 18+. 
# Input: 
# users = [ 
#   {"username": "alice", "email": "a@b.com", "age": 25, "active": True}, 
#   {"username": "bob", "email": "b@b.com", "age": 17, "active": True}, 
#   {"username": "carol", "email": "c@b.com", "age": 30, "active": False}, 
#   {"username": "dave", "email": "d@b.com", "age": 22, "active": True}, 
# ] 
# Output: 
# {'alice': 'a@b.com', 'dave': 'd@b.com'} 
# Constraints: 
# Use a single dictionary comprehension (one line) 
# Both conditions (active AND age >= 18) must be met 

 






users = [
    {"username": "alice", "email": "a@b.com", "age": 25, "active": True},
    {"username": "bob", "email": "b@b.com", "age": 17, "active": True},
    {"username": "carol", "email": "c@b.com", "age": 30, "active": False},
    {"username": "dave", "email": "d@b.com", "age": 22, "active": True},
]

result = {
    user["username"]: user["email"]
    for user in users
    if user["active"] and user["age"] >= 18
}
